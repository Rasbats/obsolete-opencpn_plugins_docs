=== Five Configurations that will Compute

Confirm that the Weather_Routing Plugin has been installed.

+++*Files & Pathnames*+++

It is important that you use this configuration for Windows (Linux use
comparable User accessible directories):

. Main Path for support files:
_C:\ProgramData\opencpn\plugins\weather_routing_
. WeatherRoutingConfiguration.xml:
_C:\ProgramData\opencpn\plugins\weather_routing_
. Polar Files (.pol,.txt,.csv):
_C:\ProgramData\opencpn\plugins\weather_routing\polars_
. Boat.Xml Files: _C:\ProgramData\opencpn\plugins\weather_routing\boat_
. Grib-Sample File:
_C:\ProgramData\opencpn\plugins\weather_routing\grib-sample_

(Note the weather_routing installation may not create these files in the
correct location, and may put them under _C:\Program Files
(x86)\opencpn\plugins\weather_routing/data_. If this is the case, just
download the Weather Routing Setup files below and install as shown
above.

==== Weather Routing Setup Files

Download and Unzip files and directories to
_C:\ProgramData\opencpn\plugins\weather_routing_

link:../../../../manual/plugins/weather_routing/weather-routing-setup.zip[Weather
Routing Setup]

Unzip and install files & directories into
_C:\ProgramData\opencpn\plugins\weather_routing_ to follow the locations
above. These files will provide you with sample files to help learn how
to weather_route.

==== Run some Weather Routing Routes

. Start Climatology_pi, although it will start automatically if called.
. Start Grib_pi and open the Irma-Jose-2017090618.gfs.grib2 file located
in _C:\ProgramData\opencpn\plugins\weather_routing\grib-sample_ or just
copy it to your normal grib file location.
. Set the Grib Date to Wed, Sept 6 2017, UTC 21:00 and get the screen
centered on the grib.
. Then open Weather_routing_pi, you may be pointing at the wrong
directory, so Pick “_File > Open_” and browse to
_C:\ProgramData\opencpn\plugins\weather_routing_ and then select and
open “_WeatherRoutingConfiguration.xml_”.
. Confirm the “Boat section” path is correct as shown above in the
Pathname list.
. Confirm the “Polar” path is correct as shown above in the Pathname
list.
. In the menu you should find 5 configurations for routes in the
Caribbean.
. Pick a route and then select “Compute from the bottom of the menu.
. Check that the isobars and route is drawn. Then step through the
Grib_pi changing the time to see where the boat is located and how the
wind changes.
. Try “Computing” the other routes, noticing how the settings have been
changed, and what files are being used.
. Once you are pretty confident about this, go to the next step, which
is to create your own configurations.

==== Computation of 5 Routes

These are 5 Weather Routings in “*Weather-Routing-Setup*” that should
*Complete* when using the small grib file for hurricane Irma.
Weather_routing would not normally be used for this, however in
emergency situations it could be used to develop “avoidance” measures by
setting “conservative” maximum wind speeds in your polar files. These
routings below do find circuitous “avoidance” routes based upon their
Polar File values, but the values could be made more “conservative”.
*The purpose of these examples is to illustrate the dependence of
“Completed” routings on a number of values and constraints, to heighten
the user's awareness of those values.* When a routing _Fails_, the user
needs to learn and understand what values need to be adjusted.
Adjustment of _Time Interval_ is just one of the settings to be
considered in *Weather Route Configuration*.

==== Computation of Routes from Cape Canaveral with different Intervals

These routes are also in “*Weather-Routing-Setup*” and illustrate how
different Time Intervals may interact with Land causing *Failures*
depending on the configuration of the Finish point with land masses.
Notice that *Cape Canaveral 4 & 5* (4 & 5 hour Time Intervals) both
*Failed*. Changing to a smaller Time Interval is likely to help
*Complete* and so is changing the Default *Max Diverted Course* from 100
to 150 degrees, both of which will require more computation. The other
alternative is to use a different Weather Routing Position for the
Finish, which is further away from the interfering land masses.

The _optimum weather route_ that is computed changes with the _Time
Interval_ due to interaction with _Land mass_ at the edges of the _Wind
data_. Choosing Finish points that are clear from *Land Masses*, Smaller
*Time Intervals* and greater *Max Diverted Course* will generally help
in these cases. The very different routes taken with each time interval
all result in Trip times of 5days-1/2hr to 5days-4-1/2hrs which are
quite small differences given the divergent routes. In planning your
trips you may want to take advantage of these alternatives which are
shown with use of different *Time Intervals*, depending on your goals.

From Cape Canaveral - 6 hr Interval - On Default (MaxDiv=100) *Complete*

When there is a Compute _Failure_ try to understand why. Zoom in to
where the routing is failing, to see and determine that the _Time
Interval_ or _Destination Point_ is not right or too close at the
complex land - sea interface. Then change the _Time Interval_ or move
the _Destination Point_ further out to sea where the routing
calculations can be made more easily. This is just one configuration
consideration, there are others.

Here is a good example of “Avoidance Routing” around Irma. The polars
could be made more conservative (and should be), and the routing will
probably “fail” which would be a warning that a better “weather window”
is needed. *Time to prepare for the hurricane rather than running
weather-routings!*.

==== 5. WR Not a substitute for sound judgment & realistic goals

Why try to route into Irma? *You* must _Configure_ weather_routing to
match your _sound judgment_ and _realistic goals_. You are in control,
use your own judgement when you review the results. *This cannot be
emphasized enough.* Weather_Routing_pi is just a tool in your hands, you
are in control.
