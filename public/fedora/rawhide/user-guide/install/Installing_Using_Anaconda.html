<h1>Installing Using Anaconda</h1>
<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter provides step-by-step instructions for installing Fedora using the <strong class="application">Anaconda</strong> installer. The bulk of this chapter describes installation using the graphical user interface. A text mode is also available for systems with no graphical display, but this mode is limited in certain aspects (for example, custom partitioning is not possible in text mode).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your system does not have the ability to use the graphical mode, you can:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use Kickstart to automate the installation as described in <a href="../advanced/Kickstart_Installations.html#chap-kickstart-installations" class="page">Automating the Installation with Kickstart</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform the graphical installation remotely by connecting to the installation system from another computer with a graphical display using the <em>VNC</em> (Virtual Network Computing) protocol - see <a href="../advanced/VNC_Installations.html#chap-vnc-installations" class="page">Installing Using VNC</a></p>

<h2 id="sect-installation-new-users"><a class="anchor" href="#sect-installation-new-users"></a>Introduction to Anaconda</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Fedora installer, <strong class="application">Anaconda</strong>, is different from most other operating system installation programs due to its parallel nature. Most installers follow a fixed path: you must choose your language first, then you configure network, then installation type, then partitioning, etc. There is usually only one way to proceed at any given time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <strong class="application">Anaconda</strong> you are only required to select your language and locale first, and then you are presented with a central screen, where you can configure most aspects of the installation in any order you like. This does not apply to all parts of the installation process, however - for example, when installing from a network location, you must configure the network before you can select which packages to install.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some screens will be automatically configured depending on your hardware and the type of media you used to start the installation. You can still change the detected settings in any screen. Screens which have not been automatically configured, and therefore require your attention before you begin the installation, are marked by an exclamation mark. You can not start the actual installation process before you finish configuring these settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additional differences appear in certain screens; notably the custom partitioning process is very different from other Linux distributions. These differences are described in each screen&#8217;s subsection.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sections describe how to access logs and an interactive shell during the installation. This is useful when troubleshooting problems, but should not be necessary in most cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sect-installation-consoles"><a class="anchor" href="#sect-installation-consoles"></a>Accessing Consoles</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Fedora installer uses the <strong class="application">tmux</strong> terminal multiplexer to display and control several windows you can use in addition to the main interface. Each of these windows serves a different purpose - they display several different logs, which can be used to troubleshoot any issues during the installation, and one of the windows provides an interactive shell prompt with <code>root</code> privileges, unless this prompt was specifically disabled using a boot option or a Kickstart command.</p>

<h2 id="sect-installation-text-mode"><a class="anchor" href="#sect-installation-text-mode"></a>Installing in Text Mode</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Text mode installation offers an interactive, non-graphical interface for installing Fedora. This may be useful on systems with no graphical capabilities; however, you should always consider the available alternatives before starting a text-based installation. Text mode is limited in the amount of choices you can make during the installation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To start a text mode installation, boot the installation with the <span class="option">inst.text</span> boot option used either at the boot command line in the boot menu, or in your PXE server configuration. See <a href="Booting_the_Installation.html#chap-booting-the-installation" class="page">Booting the Installation</a> for information about booting and using boot options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two alternatives to text mode which can both be used even if the installation system does not have a graphical display. You can either connect to the installation system using VNC and perform an interactive graphical installation remotely (see <a href="../advanced/VNC_Installations.html#chap-vnc-installations" class="page">Installing Using VNC</a>), or you can create a Kickstart file to perform the installation automatically (see <a href="../advanced/Kickstart_Installations.html#chap-kickstart-installations" class="page">Automating the Installation with Kickstart</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. Text Mode Installation</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Installation in text mode follows a pattern similar to the graphical installation: There is no single fixed progression; you can configure many settings in any order you want using the main status screen. Screens which have already been configured, either automatically or by you, are marked as <code>[x]</code>, and screens which require your attention before the installation can begin are marked with <code>[!]</code>. Available commands are displayed below the list of available options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Limits of interactive text mode installation include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The installer will always use the English language and the US English keyboard layout. You can configure your language and keyboard settings, but these settings will only apply to the installed system, not to the installation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can not configure any advanced storage methods (LVM, software RAID, FCoE, zFCP and iSCSI).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not possible to configure custom partitioning; you must use one of the automatic partitioning settings. You also cannot configure where the boot loader will be installed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="sect-installation-graphical-mode"><a class="anchor" href="#sect-installation-graphical-mode"></a>Installing in the Graphical User Interface</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The graphical installation interface is the preferred method of manually installing Fedora. It allows you full control over all available settings, including custom partitioning and advanced storage configuration, and it is also localized to many languages other than English, allowing you to perform the entire installation in a different language. The graphical mode is used by default when you boot the system from local media (a CD, DVD or a USB flash drive).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sections below discuss each screen available in the installation process. Note that due to the installer&#8217;s parallel nature, most of the screens do not have to be completed in the order in which they are described here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each screen in the graphical interface contains a <code>Help</code> button. This button opens the <strong class="application">Yelp</strong> help browser displaying the section of the <em>Fedora Installation Guide</em> relevant to the current screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also control the graphical installer with your keyboard. Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd></span> to cycle through active control elements (buttons, check boxes, etc.) on the current screen, <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> arrow keys to scroll through lists, and <kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>Right</kbd> to scroll through horizontal toolbars or table entries. <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> can be used to select or remove a highlighted item from selection and to expand and collapse drop-down menus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, elements in each screen can be toggled using their respective shortcuts. These shortcuts are highlighted (underlined) when you hold down the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key; to toggle that element, press <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd><em>X</em></kbd></span>, where <em>X</em> is the highlighted letter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your current keyboard layout is displayed in the top right hand corner. Only one layout is configured by default; if you configure more than layout in the <code>Keyboard Layout</code> screen (<a href="#sect-installation-gui-keyboard-layout">Keyboard Layout</a>), you can switch between them by clicking the layout indicator.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sect-installation-gui-welcome"><a class="anchor" href="#sect-installation-gui-welcome"></a>Welcome Screen and Language Selection</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first screen displayed immediately after the graphical installer starts is the Welcome screen.</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 2. Welcome Screen</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, select your preferred language in the left hand side column, and then select your locale from the right hand side column. You can use the text input field in the bottom left corner to search for your language instead of looking for it in the full list of more than 70 languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The language you select on this screen will be used during the installation, and it will also be used on the installed system by default. You can change the language for the installed system later, but once you click <code>Continue</code> on this screen, you will not be able to go back and change the language used inside the installer itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One language is pre-selected by default on top of the list. If network access is configured at this point (for example, if you booted from a network server instead of local media), the pre-selected language will be determined based on automatic location detection using the GeoIP module. Alternatively, if you used the <span class="option">inst.lang=</span> option on the boot command line or in your PXE server configuration, this language will be selected by default, but you will still be able to change it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After you select your language and locale, click <code>Continue</code> to confirm your selection and proceed to <a href="#Installing_Using_Anaconda.adoc#sect-installation-gui-installation-summary" class="page unresolved">Installation Summary</a>.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>warning symbol</strong> (yellow triangle with an exclamation mark) next to an icon means that a screen requires your attention before you start the installation. This typically happens with the <code>Installation Destination</code> screen, because even though there is a default automatic partitioning variant, you always have to at least confirm this selection, even if you do not want to make any changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a link is <strong>greyed out</strong>, it means that the installer is currently configuring this section, and you must wait for the configuration to finish before accessing that screen. This typically happens when you change the installation source in the <code>Installation Source</code> screen and the installer is probing the new source location and gathering a list of available packages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Screens with <strong>black text and no warning symbol</strong> mean that this screen does not require your attention. You can still change your settings in these screens, but it is not necessary to do so to complete the installation. This typically happens with localization settings, as these are either detected automatically, or set up on the previous screen where you select your language and locale.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use iSCSI storage devices, the installer must be able to discover them as <em>iSCSI targets</em> and be able to create an iSCSI session to access them. Both of these steps may require a user name and password for <em>Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol</em> (CHAP) authentication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also configure an iSCSI target to authenticate the iSCSI initiator on the system to which the target is attached (<em>reverse CHAP</em>), both for discovery and for the session. Used together, CHAP and reverse CHAP are called <em>mutual CHAP</em> or <em>two-way CHAP</em>. Mutual CHAP provides the greatest level of security for iSCSI connections, particularly if the user name and password are different for CHAP authentication and reverse CHAP authentication.</p>

<p>Enter the IP address of the iSCSI target in the <code>Target IP Address</code> field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a name in the <code>iSCSI Initiator Name</code> field for the iSCSI initiator in <em>iSCSI Qualified Name</em> (IQN) format. A valid IQN entry contains:</p>
<div class="ulist">

<li>
<p>A date code specifying the year and month in which your organization&#8217;s Internet domain or subdomain name was registered, represented as four digits for the year, a dash, and two digits for the month, followed by a period. For example, represent September 2010 as <code>2010-09.</code></p>

<li>
<p>Your organization&#8217;s Internet domain or subdomain name, presented in <strong>reverse</strong> order (with the top-level domain first). For example, represent the subdomain storage.example.com as <code>com.example.storage</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A colon (<code>:</code>) followed by a string which uniquely identifies this particular iSCSI initiator within your domain or subdomain. For example, <code>:diskarrays-sn-a8675309</code></p>

<p>In most other installers for both Linux and other operating systems, disk partitioning usually takes a "bottom-up" approach.

<p><em>Redundant arrays of independent disks</em> (RAIDs) are constructed from multiple storage devices that are arranged to provide increased performance and, in some configurations, greater fault tolerance.

<p>A RAID device is created in one step, and disks are added or removed as necessary.

</div>
<div class="ulist">
<div class="title">Device Types</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Standard Partition</code> - A standard partition can contain a file system or swap space. Standard partitions are most commonly used for <code>/boot</code> and the BIOS Boot and EFI System partitions. LVM logical volumes or Btrfs subvolumes are recommended for most other uses. See <a href="../appendixes/Disk_Partitions.html#appe-disk-partitions-overview" class="page">An Introduction to Disk Partitions</a> for additional information about the concepts behind physical partitions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>LVM</code> - Choosing <code>LVM</code> as the <code>Device Type</code> creates an LVM logical volume and a volume group to contain it (unless one already exists, in which case the new volume is assigned to the existing group). LVM can improve performance when using physical disks and allows you to use multiple disks for a single mount point. For information on how to create a logical volume, see <a href="#Installing_Using_Anaconda.adoc#sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-lvm" class="page unresolved">Creating a Logical Volume Managament (LVM) Layout</a>. Also see <a href="../appendixes/Understanding_LVM.html#appe-lvm-overview" class="page">Understanding LVM</a> for some additional information about LVM in general.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>LVM Thin Provisioning</code> - Using thin provisioning, you can manage a storage pool of free space, known as a <em>thin pool</em>, which can be allocated to an arbitrary number of devices when needed by applications. The thin pool can be expanded dynamically when needed for cost-effective allocation of storage space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>RAID</code> - Creating two or more software RAID partitions allows you to create a software RAID device. One RAID partition is assigned to each disk on the system. See <a href="#Installing_Using_Anaconda.adoc#sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-swraid" class="page unresolved">Creating Software RAID</a> for instructions on creating software RAID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>BTRFS</code> - Btrfs is a file system with several device-like features. It is capable of addressing and managing more files, larger files, and larger volumes than the ext2, ext3, and ext4 file systems. See <a href="#Installing_Using_Anaconda.adoc#sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-btrfs" class="page unresolved">Creating a Btrfs Layout</a> for more information about creating Btrfs volumes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<div class="title">File Systems</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ext4</code> - The ext4 file system is based on the ext3 file system and features a number of improvements. These include support for larger file systems and larger files, faster and more efficient allocation of disk space, no limit on the number of subdirectories within a directory, faster file system checking, and more robust journaling. Ext4 is the default and recommended file system used by Fedora Workstation and Cloud. The maximum supported size of a single ext4 file system is 50 TB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ext3</code> - The ext3 file system is based on the ext2 file system and has one main advantage - journaling. Using a journaling file system reduces time spent recovering a file system after a crash, as there is no need to check the file system for metadata consistency by running the <span class="command">fsck</span> utility every time a crash occurs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ext2</code> - An ext2 file system supports standard Unix file types, including regular files, directories, or symbolic links. It provides the ability to assign long file names, up to 255 characters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>swap</code> - Swap partitions are used to support virtual memory. In other words, data is written to a swap partition when there is not enough RAM to store the data your system is processing. A swap partition should always be created; see <a href="#Installing_Using_Anaconda.adoc#sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-recommended" class="page unresolved">Recommended Partitioning Scheme</a> for details such as the recommended size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>xfs</code> - XFS is a highly scalable, high-performance file system that supports file systems up to 16 exabytes (approximately 16 million terabytes), files up to 8 exabytes (approximately 8 million terabytes), and directory structures containing tens of millions of entries. XFS also supports metadata journaling, which facilitates quicker crash recovery. The maximum supported size of a single XFS file system is 500 TB. Starting with Fedora&#160;22, XFS is the default and recommended file system on Fedora Server.</p>

<p><code>RAID0 (Performance)</code> - Distributes data across multiple disks. Level 0 RAID offers increased performance over standard partitions and can be used to pool the storage of multiple disks into one large virtual device. Note that Level 0 RAIDs offer no redundancy and that the failure of one device in the array destroys data in the entire array. RAID 0 requires at least two disks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>RAID1 (Redundancy)</code> - Mirrors all data from one partition onto one or more other disks. Additional devices in the array provide increasing levels of redundancy. RAID 1 requires at least two disks.</p>

<li>
<p><code>RAID4 (Error Checking)</code> - Distributes data across multiple disks and uses one disk in the array to store parity information which safeguards the array in case any disk within the array fails. Because all parity information is stored on one disk, access to this disk creates a "bottleneck" in the array&#8217;s performance. Level 4 RAID requires at least three disks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>RAID5 (Distributed Error Checking)</code> - Distributes data and parity information across multiple disks. Level 5 RAIDs therefore offer the performance advantages of distributing data across multiple disks, but do not share the performance bottleneck of level 4 RAIDs because the parity information is also distributed through the array. RAID 5 requires at least three disks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>RAID6 (Redundant Error Checking)</code> - Level 6 RAIDs are similar to level 5 RAIDs, but instead of storing only one set of parity data, they store two sets. RAID 6 requires at least four disks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>RAID10 (Performance, Redundancy)</code> - Level 10 RAIDs are nested RAIDs or hybrid RAIDs. They are constructed by distributing data over mirrored sets of disks. For example, a level 10 RAID array constructed from four RAID partitions consists of two mirrored pairs of striped partitions. RAID 10 requires at least four disks.</p>

<p>Swap partitions support virtual memory; data is written to them when there is not enough RAM to store the data your system is processing. This partition&#8217;s size is a function of system memory workload, not total system memory, and therefore is not equal to the total system memory size. Therefore, it is important to analyze what applications a system will be running and the load those applications will serve in order to determine the system memory workload. Application providers and developers should be able to provide some guidance.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the system runs out of swap space, the kernel terminates processes as the system RAM memory is exhausted. Configuring too much swap space results in storage devices being allocated but idle and is a poor use of resources. Too much swap space can also hide memory leaks. The maximum size for a swap partition and other additional information can be found in the <code>mkswap(8)</code> man page.</p>

<h4 id="sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-advice"><a class="anchor" href="#sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-advice"></a>Advice on Partitions</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no best way to partition every system; the optimal setup depends on how you plan to use the system being installed. However, the following tips may help you find the optimal layout for your needs:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consider encrypting any partitions and volumes which might contain sensitive data. Encryption prevents unauthorized people from accessing the data on the partitions, even if they have access to the physical storage device. In most cases, you should at least encrypt the <code>/home</code> partition, which contains user data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some cases, creating separate mount points for directories other than <code>/</code>, <code>/boot</code> and <code>/home</code> may be useful; for example, on a server running a <strong class="application">MySQL</strong> database, having a separate mount point for <code>/var/lib/mysql</code> will allow you to preserve the database during a reinstallation without having to restore it from backup afterwards. However, having unnecessary separate mount points will make storage administration more difficult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some special restrictions apply to certain directories with regards on which partitioning layouts can they be placed. Notably, the <code>/boot</code> directory must always be on a physical partition (not on an LVM volume or a Btrfs subvolume), and <code>/usr</code> can not be on a Btrfs subvolume.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are new to Linux, consider reviewing the <em class="citetitle">Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</em> at <a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_2.3/fhs-2.3.html" class="bare">https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_2.3/fhs-2.3.html</a> for information about various system directories and their contents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each kernel installed on your system requires approximately 20 MB on the <code>/boot</code> partition. The default partition size of 500 MB for <code>/boot</code> should suffice for most common uses; increase the size of this partition if you plan to keep many kernels installed at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>/var</code> directory holds content for a number of applications, including the <strong class="application">Apache</strong> web server, and is used by the <strong class="application">DNF</strong> package manager to temporarily store downloaded package updates. Make sure that the partition or volume containing <code>/var</code> has at least 3 GB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contents of the <code>/var</code> directory usually change very often. This may cause problems with older solid state drives (SSDs), as they can handle a lower number of read/write cycles before becoming unusable. If your system root is on an SSD, consider creating a separate mount point for <code>/var</code> on a classic (platter) HDD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>/usr</code> directory holds the majority of software on a typical Fedora installation. The partition or volume containing this directory should therefore be at least 5 GB for minimal installations, and at least 10 GB for installations with a graphical environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <code>/usr</code> or <code>/var</code> is partitioned separately from the rest of the root volume, the boot process becomes much more complex because these directories contain boot-critical components. In some situations, such as when these directories are placed on an iSCSI drive or an FCoE location, the system may either be unable to boot, or it may hang with a <code>Device is busy</code> error when powering off or rebooting.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This limitation only applies to <code>/usr</code> or <code>/var</code>, not to directories below them. For example, a separate partition for <code>/var/www</code> will work without issues.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider leaving a portion of the space in an LVM volume group unallocated. This unallocated space gives you flexibility if your space requirements change but you do not wish to remove data from other volumes. You can also select the <code>Thin provisioning</code> device type for the partition to have the unused space handled automatically by the volume.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The size of an <code>XFS</code> file system can not be reduced - if you need to make a partition or volume with this file system smaller, you must back up your data, destroy the file system, and create a new, smaller one in its place. Therefore, if you expect needing to manipulate your partitioning layout later, you should use the <code>ext4</code> file system instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Logical Volume Management (LVM) if you anticipate expanding your storage by adding more hard drives after the installation. With LVM, you can create physical volumes on the new drives, and then assign them to any volume group and logical volume as you see fit - for example, you can easily expand your system&#8217;s <code>/home</code> (or any other directory residing on a logical volume).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a BIOS Boot partition or an EFI System Partition may be necessary, depending on your system&#8217;s firmware, boot drive size, and boot drive disk label. See <a href="#Installing_Using_Anaconda.adoc#sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-recommended" class="page unresolved">Recommended Partitioning Scheme</a> for information about these partitions. Note that the graphical installer will not let you create a BIOS Boot or EFI System Partition if your system does <strong>not</strong> require one - in that case, they will be hidden from the menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need to make any changes to your storage configuration after the installation, Fedora repositories offer several different tools which can help you do this. If you prefer a command line tool, try <strong class="package">system-storage-manager</strong>.</p>

A dialog will appear that allows you to configure the selected connection. The configuration options presented depends on the connection type - the available options will be slightly different depending on whether it is a physical interface (wired or wireless network interface controller) or a virtual interface (Bond, Team or Vlan) which you previously configured in <a href="#sect-installation-gui-network-configuration-virtual-interface">Adding a Virtual Network Interface</a>.. A full description of all configuration settings for all connection types is beyond the scope of this document; see the <em class="citetitle">Networking Guide</em> for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most common and useful options in the configuration dialog are:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Enable or disable the connection by default</dt>
<dd>
<p>In the <code>General</code> tab of the configuration dialog, you can select or unselect the <code>Automatically connect to this network when it is available</code> check box to allow or disallow this connection to connect by default. When enabled on a wired connection, this means the system will typically connect during startup (unless you unplug the network cable); on a wireless connection, it means that the interface will attempt to connect to any known wireless networks in range.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, you can allow or disallow all users on the system from connecting to this network using the <code>All users may connect to this network</code> option. If you disable this option, only <code>root</code> will be able to connect to this network.</p>

<p>By default, both <code>IPv4</code> and <code>IPv6</code> are set to automatic configuration depending on current network settings. This means that addresses such as the local IP address, DNS address, and other settings will be detected automatically each time the interface connects to a network. In many cases, this is sufficient, but you can also provide static configuration in the <code>IPv4 Settings</code> and <code>IPv6 Settings</code>, respectively.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To set static network configuration, navigate to one of the settings tabs and select a method other than <code>Automatic</code> (for example, <code>Manual</code>) from the <code>Method</code> drop-down menu. This will enable the <code>Addresses</code> field below.</p>

<p>Then, click <code>Add</code> on the right side and add a set of settings: <code>Address</code>, <code>Netmask</code> (for <code>IPv4</code>), <code>Prefix</code> (for <code>IPv6</code>), and <code>Gateway</code>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>DNS servers</code> field accepts one or more IP addresses of DNS servers - for example, <code>10.0.0.1,10.0.0.8</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The final option in both tabs is <code>Require IPv<em>X</em> addressing for this connection to complete</code>. Select this option in the <code>IPv4</code> tab to only allow this connection if <code>IPv4</code> was successful; the same principle applies to this setting in the <code>IPv6</code> tab. If this option remains disabled for both <code>IPv4</code> and <code>IPv6</code>, the interface will be able to connect if configuration succeeds on either IP protocol.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Configure routes</dt>
<dd>
<p>In the <code>IPv4 Settings</code> and <code>IPv4 Settings</code> tabs, click the <code>Routes</code> button in the bottom right corner to configure routing settings for a specific IP protocol on an interface. A new dialog will open, allowing you to <code>Add</code> a specific route.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you confire at least one static route, you can disallow all routes not specifically configured here by enabling the <code>Ignore automatically obtained routes</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Select <code>Use this connection only for resources on its network</code> to prevent this connection from becoming the default route. This option can be selected even if you did not configure any static routes. Enabling this option means that this route will only be used when necessary to access certain resources, such as intranet pages which require a local or VPN connection. Another (default) route will be used for publicly available resources if possible. Note that unlike the additional routes configured in this dialog, this setting will be transferred to the installed system. Also note that this option is only useful when more than one interface is configured.</p>
