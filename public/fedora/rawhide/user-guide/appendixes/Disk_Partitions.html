<p>Hard disks perform a very simple function - they store data and reliably retrieve it on command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When discussing issues such as disk partitioning, it is important to have a understanding of the underlying hardware; however, since the theory is very complicated and expansive, only the basic concepts will be explained here. This appendix uses a set of simplified diagrams of a disk drive to help explain what is the process and theory behind partitions.</p>

<p>To store data on a disk drive, it is necessary to <em>format</em> the disk drive first. Formatting (usually known as "making a <em>file system</em>") writes information to the drive, creating order out of the empty space in an unformatted drive.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As <a href="#figu-partitions-formatted-drive">Disk Drive with a File System</a>, implies, the order imposed by a file system involves some trade-offs:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A small percentage of the driver&#8217;s available space is used to store file system-related data and can be considered as overhead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A file system splits the remaining space into small, consistently-sized segments. For Linux, these segments are known as <em>blocks</em> <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that there is no single, universal file system. As <a href="#figu-partitions-different-file-system">Disk Drive with a Different File System</a>, shows, a disk drive may have one of many different file systems written on it. Different file systems tend to be incompatible; that is, an operating system that supports one file system (or a handful of related file system types) may not support another. However, Fedora supports a wide variety of file systems (including many commonly used by other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows), making data interchange between different file systems easy.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Writing a file system to disk is only the first step. The goal of this process is to actually <strong>store</strong> and <strong>retrieve</strong> data. The figure below shows a drive disk after some data have been written to it:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As <a href="#figu-partitions-drive-with-data">Disk Drive with Data Written to It</a>, shows, some of the previously-empty blocks are now holding data. However, by just looking at this picture, we cannot determine exactly how many files reside on this drive. There may only be one file or many, as all files use at least one block and some files use multiple blocks. Another important point to note is that the used blocks do not have to form a contiguous region; used and unused blocks may be interspersed. This is known as <em>fragmentation</em>. Fragmentation can play a part when attempting to resize an existing partition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with most computer-related technologies, disk drives changed over time after their introduction. In particular, they got bigger. Not larger in physical size, but bigger in their capacity to store information. And, this additional capacity drove a fundamental change in the way disk drives were used.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sect-disk-partitions-basics"><a class="anchor" href="#sect-disk-partitions-basics"></a>Partitions: Turning One Drive Into Many</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Disk drives can be divided into <em>partitions</em>. Each partition can be accessed as if it was a separate disk. This is done through the addition of a <em>partition table</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several reasons for allocating disk space into separate disk partitions, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Logical separation of the operating system data from the user data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to use different file systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to run multiple operating systems on one machine</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are currently two partitioning layout standards for physical hard disks: Master Boot Record (<strong>MBR</strong>) and GUID Partition Table (<strong>GPT</strong>). <strong>MBR</strong> is an older method of disk partitioning used with BIOS-based computers. <strong>GPT</strong> is a newer partitioning layout that is a part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (<strong>UEFI</strong>). This section and <a href="#sect-disk-partitions-extended">Partitions Within Partitions - An Overview of Extended Partitions</a> mainly describe the <em>Master Boot Record</em> (<strong>MBR</strong>) disk partitioning scheme.

<p>While the diagrams in this chapter show the partition table as being separate from the actual disk drive, this is not entirely accurate.

<div class="title">Figure 5. Disk Drive with Partition Table</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As <a href="#figu-partitions-partition-table">Disk Drive with Partition Table</a> shows, the partition table is divided into four sections or four <em>primary</em> partitions. A primary partition is a partition on a hard drive that can contain only one logical drive (or section). Each section can hold the information necessary to define a single partition, meaning that the partition table can define no more than four partitions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each partition table entry contains several important characteristics of the partition:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The points on the disk where the partition starts and ends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the partition is "active"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The partition&#8217;s type</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The starting and ending points define the partition&#8217;s size and location on the disk. The "active" flag is used by some operating systems' boot loaders. In other words, the operating system in the partition that is marked "active" is booted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The type is a number that identifies the partition&#8217;s anticipated usage. Some operating systems use the partition type to denote a specific file system type, to flag the partition as being associated with a particular operating system, to indicate that the partition contains a bootable operating system, or some combination of the three.</p>

<p>In case four partitions are insufficient for your needs, you can use <em>extended partitions</em> to create up additional partitions. You do this by setting the type of a partition to "Extended".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An extended partition is like a disk drive in its own right - it has its own partition table which points to one or more partitions (now called <em>logical partitions</em>, as opposed to the four <em>primary partitions</em>) contained entirely within the extended partition itself. <a href="#figu-partitions-extended">Disk Drive With Extended Partition</a>, shows a disk drive with one primary partition and one extended partition containing two logical partitions (along with some unpartitioned free space).</p>

<p>As this figure implies, there is a difference between primary and logical partitions - there can only be four primary partitions, but there is no fixed limit to the number of logical partitions that can exist.

<h3 id="sect-disk-partitioning-guid-partition-table"><a class="anchor" href="#sect-disk-partitioning-guid-partition-table"></a>GUID Partition Table (GPT)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GUID Partition Table (<strong>GPT</strong>) is a newer partitioning scheme based on using Globally Unique Identifiers (<strong>GUID</strong>). <strong>GPT</strong> was developed to cope with limitations of the <strong>MBR</strong> partition table, especially with the limited maximum addressable storage space of a disk. Unlike <strong>MBR</strong>, which is unable to address storage space larger than 2.2 terabytes, <strong>GPT</strong> can be used with hard disks larger than this; the maximum addressable disk size is 2.2 zettabytes. In addition, <strong>GPT</strong> by default supports creating up to 128 primary partitions. This number could be extended by allocating more space to the partition table.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>GPT</strong> disks use logical block addressing (LBA) and the partition layout is as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>To preserve backward compatibility with MBR disks, the first sector (<strong>LBA</strong> 0) of <strong>GPT</strong> is reserved for <strong>MBR</strong> data and it is called "protective MBR".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>primary <strong>GPT</strong> header</em> begins on the second logical block (<strong>LBA</strong> 1) of the device. The header contains the disk GUID, the location of the primary partition table, the location of the secondary GPT header, and CRC32 checksums of itself and the primary partition table. It also specifies the number of partition entries of the table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>primary <strong>GPT</strong> table</em> includes, by default, 128 partition entries, each with an entry size 128 bytes, its partition type GUID and unique partition GUID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>secondary <strong>GPT</strong> table</em> is identical to the primary <strong>GPT</strong> table. It is used mainly as a backup table for recovery in case the primary partition table is corrupted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>secondary <strong>GPT</strong> header</em> is located on the last logical sector of the disk and it can be used to recover <strong>GPT</strong> information in case the primary header is corrupted. It contains the disk GUID, the location of the secondary partition table and the primary <strong>GPT</strong> header, CRC32 checksums of itself and the secondary partition table, and the number of possible partition entries.</p>

<p>An unused hard disk also falls into this category. The only difference is that <strong>all</strong> the space is not part of any defined partition.</p>

<p>In any case, you can create the necessary partitions from the unused space. Unfortunately, this scenario, although very simple, is not very likely (unless you have just purchased a new disk just for Fedora).

<p>In this case, the single large partition is deleted and several smaller ones are created instead. Any data held in the original partition is destroyed. This means that making a complete backup is necessary. It is highly recommended to make two backups, use verification (if available in your backup software), and try to read data from the backup <strong>before</strong> deleting the partition.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the following figure shows, the first step is to compress the data in your existing partition. The reason for doing this is to rearrange the data such that it maximizes the available free space at the "end" of the partition.</p>

<p>This step is crucial. Without it, the location of the data could prevent the partition from being resized to the extent desired. Note also that, for one reason or another, some data cannot be moved. If this is the case (and it severely restricts the size of your new partition(s)), you may be forced to destructively repartition your disk.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A common source of confusion for users unfamiliar with Linux is the matter of how partitions are used and accessed by the Linux operating system. In DOS/Windows, it is relatively simple: Each partition gets a "drive letter." You then use the correct drive letter to refer to files and directories on its corresponding partition. This is entirely different from how Linux deals with partitions and, for that matter, with disk storage in general. This section describes the main principles of partition naming scheme and the way how partitions are accessed in Fedora.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sect-disk-partitions-naming-scheme"><a class="anchor" href="#sect-disk-partitions-naming-scheme"></a>Partition Naming Scheme</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Linux uses a naming scheme that is file-based, with file names in the form of <code>/dev/<em>xxyN</em></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Device and partition names consist of the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><code>/dev/</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the name of the directory in which all device files reside. Because partitions reside on hard disks, and hard disks are devices, the files representing all possible partitions reside in <code>/dev/</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><code><em>xx</em></code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The first two letters of the partition name indicate the type of device on which the partition resides, usually <code>sd</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><code><em>y</em></code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This letter indicates which device the partition is on. For example, <code>/dev/sda</code> for the first hard disk, <code>/dev/sdb</code> for the second, and so on.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><code><em>N</em></code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The final number denotes the partition. The first four (primary or extended) partitions are numbered <code>1</code> through <code>4</code>. Logical partitions start at <code>5</code>. So, for example, <code>/dev/sda3</code> is the third primary or extended partition on the first hard disk, and <code>/dev/sdb6</code> is the second logical partition on the second hard disk.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if your system can identify and refer to all types of disk partitions, it might not be able to <strong>read</strong> the file system and therefore access stored data on every partition type. However, in many cases, it is possible to successfully access data on a partition dedicated to another operating system.</p>

<h3 id="sect-disk-partitions-mount-points"><a class="anchor" href="#sect-disk-partitions-mount-points"></a>Disk Partitions and Mount Points</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each partition is used to form part of the storage necessary to support a single set of files and directories. This is done by associating a partition with a directory through a process known as <em>mounting</em>. Mounting a partition makes its storage available starting at the specified directory (known as a <em>mount point</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if partition <code>/dev/sda5</code> is mounted on <code>/usr/</code>, that would mean that all files and directories under <code>/usr/</code> physically reside on <code>/dev/sda5</code>. So the file <code>/usr/share/doc/FAQ/txt/Linux-FAQ</code> would be stored on <code>/dev/sda5</code>, while the file <code>/etc/gdm/custom.conf</code> would not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Continuing the example, it is also possible that one or more directories below <code>/usr/</code> would be mount points for other partitions. For instance, a partition (say, <code>/dev/sda7</code>) could be mounted on <code>/usr/local/</code>, meaning that <code>/usr/local/man/whatis</code> would then reside on <code>/dev/sda7</code> rather than <code>/dev/sda5</code>.</p>

<h3 id="sect-disk-partitions-how-many"><a class="anchor" href="#sect-disk-partitions-how-many"></a>How Many Partitions?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point in the process of preparing to install Fedora, you should give some consideration to the number and size of the partitions to be used by your new operating system. However, there is no one right answer to this question. It depends on your needs and requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unless you have a reason for doing otherwise, you should <strong>at least</strong> create a <code>/boot</code> partition and a <code>/</code> (root) partition. Depending on your system&#8217;s hardware specifications, additional partitions may be necessary, such as <code>/boot/efi</code> for 64-bit AMD and Intel systems with UEFI firmware, a <code>biosboot</code> partition for AMD and Intel systems with a GUID Partition Table (GPT) label on the system disk, or a <code>PReP Boot</code> partition on IBM Power Systems servers.</p>
